**Kikofri** is a theme for `jekyll` that started out as a fork of the [Kiko
theme][1]. Today I'd say Kikofri is Kiko mangled beyond recognition. It came
about because I like my themes like I like my music: ugly, old and barren. It's
an assortment of hacks filtered through web-design choices from the turn of the
millennium.

The theme doesn't use any Google Analytics spyware, and it doesn't rely on
Google Fonts API for font rendering and the like. Since I never particularly
liked '[jekyll-seo-tag][2]' there's second-rate implementation of it under
`\_includes/head.html`. Pure `liquid`. Configure it to your liking. The _absence_
of "...battle-tested" templates infused with hype-words is guaranteed.

### Quirks Mode: [](){:id="micros"}

Kikofri comes with a few _quirks_. Since I'm an old person in an young body my
sense of humor is dry. Therefore I decided to call the quirky [macro][4]-like
thingies 'micros', and thus we use the **`µ`** symbol to make the most of them.
(Honestly they're just liquid filters). Take a look at
'[\_layouts/post.html][5]' if you wonder how they are implemented. 

The sequences are:

* **micro-hash**:  
    Produces "Wikipedia-Style" reference links:
    - "micro-hash" equals 'left bracket' ( **`µ#`** = '**`<sup>[`**' ),
    - "hash-micro" equals 'right bracket' ( **`#µ`** = '**`]</sup>`**' )
            
* **micro-semis**:  
    Produces "Bring Attention To element" tag:
    - "micro-semis" ('**`µ;;`**)' equals '**`<b>`**'
    - "semis-micro" ('**`;;µ`**') equals '**`</b>`**'
            
* **micro-micro** (What a stupid name):  
    Indentation:
    - "micro-micro" ("**`µµ`**") "**`&emsp;`**"

{% capture motherdemon %}
**Example:** Here comes the stepmother of all demo(n)sµ#[a][reflink]#µ. I
really need to put µ;;emphasis;;µ on the next paragraph.

µµ A paragraph like all others, but this one is mine. It is also a little too
long because I need to put enough letters here to justify this indented poorly
worded paragraph.
{% endcapture %}

{{ motherdemon | replace: 'µ#', '<sup>[' | replace: '#µ', ']</sup>'
| replace: 'µ;;', '<b>' | replace: ';;µ', '</b>'
| replace: "µµ", "&emsp;" }}


Here's how it looks in a source file:

```
Here comes the stepmother of all demo(n)sµ#[a][reflink]#µ. I really
need to put µ;;emphasis;;µ on the next paragraph.

µµ A paragraph like all others... /* And so on */
```

Why use 'micros'? Well, you don't need to. Rip 'em out if you want to. Since
I'm used to ugly stuff I just prefer not to use too many fancy plugins. Take a
look at the reference link especially; '`µ#[a][reflink]#µ`' Ain't it ugly?
***Yes it is***, _and it's awesome_.

Markdown can be pretty awkward too though. Ever tried to wrap all lines at a
specific column no matter the cost because you dislike long lines? Ever done it
while trying to produce a clickable image link _with a caption_? Don't try it.
That's what killed Superman.<style>a.d{color: #fff;font-weight:bold;}a.d:hover
{color:#000;}</style><a class="d"> TWICE!!!</a>?

### Other notes: ###

I've at least _tried_ to take a modular approach. That is to break up the theme
into smaller, more or less  self-contained parts, in the form of 'includes'
where applicable.

There is also a configurable front matter value '`pagin`' which serves as a
switch for this theme's "pagination"/archive feature. The variable '`pagnum`'
can be found under `_default.html`. It decides the number of entries at
`index.html` and the offset in the archive. (Default: 10).

The [archive](/archive) is just a neat list of posts. Since few will write
3048+ articles, it'll do. Plain HTML/CSS.

### Some Poetry: ###

**On a more idealistic note**: I always _hated_ the word "blog". I recognize
one "blog" and it's [this one][8]. I always preferred the concept of a site,
because it can be anything. A newspaper, an encyclopedia, a collections of
essays or a book. The 'micros' are small and simple hacks to turn a "blog" into
something more than just a "blog".

They are stupid unlikely sequences of symbols to create some neat stuff. While
still sticking to the goal of being ugly and a _"dirty and malnourished jekyll
theme"_ of course.

Since I eschew the "blog"-aspect of it all Kikofri uses the 'Article' type
instead of the 'BlogPosting' type [in it's meta-data][9].

### What It All Boils Down To: ###

There's no reason to use something fancy  when you can accomplish the same
things with HTML/CSS.

The thing is: a lot of the things people might want to say, write or show won't
really require all that much. Even if it does it's rarely as much as the first
5 search engine results makes you think.

Kikofri tries to keep it simple, being partly flawed by design, but hopefully
not too flawed. It looks the way it wants instead of following trends and it
strives to be reasonably easy to modify. Tweaking is learning.

Well, of course... You can't turn the world upside down with a theme, but
worrying about your "content", "workflow" and striving to be an automaton
spewing out mere fluff, i.e. "content", is useless.

[_Don't call it "content"_][works]. It diminishes your work. It makes you a
commodity and what you create some kind of placeholder waiting to be replaced.

Or to quote [Proudhon][prod] who put it so eloquently (replace 'man' with your
proper noun if you want to):

> No extended argument would be required to show that the power to take from a
> man his thought, his will, his personality, is a power of life and death; and
> that to enslave a man is to kill him. Why, then, to this other question: WHAT
> IS PROPERTY! may I not likewise answer, IT IS THEFT...

### Other Important information... [](){:id="gistofit"}

...usually resides [**HERE**](https://github.com/kxxvii/Kikofri/tree/master),
there are comments in the source files too, but a few clarifications would be
in order:

#### `_includes`

* `arch_css.html`: Just some cosmetic inline `CSS` for `archive.md`.
  - If you find the `archive` page to be boring I'll tell you this: **IT'S
    SUPPOSED TO BE BORING!** A _long_ boring list for the masses.
* `top_small.html`: Includes `site.name`, or something else if you'd like, at
  the top of pages. Also makes it easy to exclude from a given page.
* `foot.html`: Footer. Closes "open tags" in `head.html`.
* `head.html`: Apart from being `<head>` it contains meta-data. Some of it can
  be modified in this file, but see `captures.html` for more variables. Entries
  like:
    
{% raw %}
```
<meta name="author" content="{{ site.author }}" />
<meta name="description" content="{{ site.description }}" />
```
{% endraw %}

Can be set in `_config.yml` for example.
* `captures.html` Contains most of the meta-data variables for `head.html`. You
  can use these or set value values by hand.

#### `_layouts`

* `default.html`: Creates the index page, and contains `pagnum` post entries.
* `pages.html`: For separate pages like `about.md`. Also included in:
* `post.html`: A post-specific layout. Useful if you want to make further
  changes to posts and pages separately.
* `pages`/`post` also  contains the [`micros`](#micros) markup.

#### `assets` directory

Contains 'pages', 'images' and 'style.css' to make the root directory less
cluttered.

* `archive.md`: "placeholder" to produce the archive page. Contains the
  variable `pagin` that can be true or false.
  - `pagin` is also found in `index.html`, it's basically just for telling
    jekyll when to produce a paginated(ish) page. If true: `offset=pagnum`, if
    false: `limit=pagnum`.
  - It's conceivable that one could use `pagin`/`pagnum` to produce a second
    archive page for example.

* `tags.md` contains a bunch in inline `CSS`. The file itself produces the tags
  page. Since any "day-to-day"-editing of it seem unlikely — it's automated —
  it might as well stay there.
